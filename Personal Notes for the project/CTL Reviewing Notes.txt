String
{
	1. Make all "namespace"s macros-replaced instead of direct. (Done)
	2. Display a compiler error if user is compiling with C++ version older than C++17. (Done)
	3. Create an Insert method.
	4. Create a IsFilled(), and IsEmpty() (Done)
	5. try to find a shortcut for the constructor that takes a string and an optional size.
	6. Make a FindAll method. (later phase)
	7. Review compiler error message in AppendAll method if data type is wrong.
	8. Try to make it possible to have the string on stack under certain circumstances (on Experimental Branch)
	{
		For example,
		if string constructor has been called, we just copy the pointer.
	}
	9. Try to figure out a shortcut for .IsSomething() methods (asem's request - tried already and failed)
	10. "Possibly" create an Index method that takes multiple arguments and returns the index of the first one of them found (if done, remember to review .Title() method too).
	11. Replace all m_Buffer[0] with *m_Buffer where possible.
	12. Review your macros names
	13. "think of" creating a ChangeIterableSize() macro
	14. After Creating Array Class, re-review the InPlaceReplace in Dynamic::String class!
	15. Re-order member methods in alphabetical order.

	Stopped at but didn't finish: template<typename T, typename H>
	CONSTEXPR20 String Replace(const T& toFindStr, const H& toReplStr)

	# Finished Notes taking !
